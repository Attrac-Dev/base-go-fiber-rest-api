testing out the Go Fiber framework, which is very similar to Express.js

every import needs to be added using the <br>
`go get -u <some github url>`

This follows along with the tutorial on [dev.to](https://dev.to/percoguru/getting-started-with-apis-in-golang-feat-fiber-and-gorm-2n34).
<br><br>The tutorial used "notes" as the main api resource, but this is going to be a repo made with the purpose of cloning it to shorten API development times. The resource here is going to be a little more generic.
